            <h2>Maths Pathway</h2>
            <h3>Making mathematics a subject all students enjoy</h3>

            <p>When I went to school, everyone learned maths the same way. The teacher would start the lesson with: ‚ÄúEveryone turn to chapter 7‚Äù. The idea that all students must learn the same content is what Maths Pathway is flipping on its head. With Maths Pathway, all students learn the maths that <b>they are ready for.</b> This is enabled by intuitive technology and amazing teachers.</p>

            <p>All students sit an initial test to determine what their maths knowledge is. For a year 7 class, some students might be at level 4. Other students might be at level 8. That‚Äôs OK. We can‚Äôt look back. What we can do is provide students with maths that‚Äôll make the most impact on their learning. And that‚Äôs the maths they are ready to learn.</p>

            <p>Over 300 schools in Australia use this approach to teaching maths. Not only do students work on maths that‚Äôs perfectly tailored to their needs, but teachers get powerful data tools that improve their teaching practices. Instead of teaching 25 kids the same content, teachers have accurate data on all of their students which means that things like mini-lessons are possible. Working with 4-5 students at a time, you can target your teaching like never before.</p>

            <p>Soon after starting at Maths Pathway, I was tasked with redesigning the student experience. As the first designer, there was a lot of design work to do. Working closely with internal stakeholders and conducting user research workshops, an initial prototype was designed and then developed over the course of several months.</p>

            <p>Throughout this time, ongoing improvements were delivered to the teacher experience, new data reports, improved UX and refined visuals.</p>

            <p>After this project was completed, another large project was tackled: redesigning the teacher experience. </p>

            <h2>Role summary</h2>
            <p>I led the redesign of the student web application used by 70,000 primary and high school students. I redesigned the teacher web application and created the framework for the development of future product vision. I helped foster a positive attitude towards product design within the engineering team. I facilitated user feedback workshops and brainstorming sessions. Other activities such as specification writing, designing user interfaces, design thinking, bench testing and contributing directly to the codebase by writing production HTML and CSS.</p>
