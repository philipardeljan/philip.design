                <br>
                <h3>Role summary</h3>
                <p>I led the redesign of the student web application used by 70,000 primary and high school students. I redesigned the teacher web application and created the framework for the development of future product vision. I helped foster a positive attitude towards product design within the engineering team. I facilitated user feedback workshops and brainstorming sessions. Other activities such as specification writing, designing user interfaces, design thinking, bench testing and contributing directly to the codebase by writing production HTML and CSS.</p>

                    <li>Redesigned the student app</li>

                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>When I went to school, everyone learned maths the same way. The teacher would start the lesson with: “Everyone turn to chapter 7”. The idea that all students must learn the same content is what Maths Pathway is flipping on its head. With Maths Pathway, all students learn the maths that <b>they are ready for.</b> This is enabled by intuitive technology and amazing teachers.</p>

                <p>All students sit an initial test to determine what their maths knowledge is. For a year 7 class, some students might be at level 4. Other students might be at level 8. That’s OK. We can’t look back. What we can do is provide students with maths that’ll make the most impact on their learning. And that’s the maths they are ready to learn.</p>

                <p>Over 300 schools in Australia use this approach to teaching maths. Not only do students work on maths that’s perfectly tailored to their needs, but teachers get powerful data tools that improve their teaching practices. Instead of teaching 25 kids the same content, teachers have accurate data on all of their students which means that things like mini-lessons are possible. Working with 4-5 students at a time, you can target your teaching like never before.</p>

                <p>Soon after starting at Maths Pathway, I was tasked with redesigning the student experience. As the first designer, there was a lot of design work to do. Working closely with internal stakeholders and conducting user research workshops, an initial prototype was designed and then developed over the course of several months.</p>

                <p>Throughout this time, ongoing improvements were delivered to the teacher experience, new data reports, improved UX and refined visuals.</p>

                <p>After this project was completed, another large project was tackled: redesigning the teacher experience. </p>

                <h3>Role summary</h3>
                <p>I led the redesign of the Profarmer web application, a daily grain pricing service used by thousands of grain farmers and analysts in the Australian grain industry. This work informed my redesign of the Profarmer marketing website and the Profarmer iPhone and iPad applications. I designed the standalone SalesMate iPhone application, a service which helps farmers make decisions on how much of their wheat crop to sell at a given time. I designed the physical booths used by the business for the Australian Grains Industry Conference (AGIC).</p>

                    <li>Led the redesign of the Profarmer web application</li>

                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>The New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) had a small office in St Kilda, Melbourne which worked on building tools for stakeholders in the Australian grain industry. A grain trading platform (Clear) and price discovery tools (Profarmer) were part of this suite of tools.</p>

                <p>My first project was redesigning the Profarmer price tool. This web app was used by thousands of grain farmers and analysts to track the price of Wheat, Barley, Canola and many other grain and cereal products. The redesigned simplified the experience, with a focus on making prices transparent and the focus of the UI.</p>

                <figcaption>The redesign of the Profarmer site pricing page</figcaption>

                <p>The main way to find grain prices is to search for grain storage locations. As such an onboarding experience was designed and developed which helped users understand how the search feature works. The redesign of the Profarmer web app lead to the redesigned of the marketing website and the Profarmer iPhone and iPad applications. I led all of these design efforts.</p>

                <p>Another project I was involved in was designing and developing the SalesMate iPhone application. This app provided a service which helps farmers make decisions on how much of their wheat crop to sell at a given time. Based on their risk profile and expected yield, a recommendation would be made which farmers can use to help guide their decisions.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>Role summary</h3>
                <p>I designed new product features, redesigned the marketing website and redesigned the knowledge base. I worked on the internal “Saasu 2023” UI concept. This UI concept helped drive future product development. I created graphics and animations for the website and blog.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Designed major new product features</li>
                    <li>Redesigned and built the marketing website</li>
                    <li>Redesigned and built the help centre</li>
                    <li>Designed the internal “Saasu 2023” UI concept</li>

                <br>
                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>Saasu is online accounting software. This was my first design role and I’m still incredibly grateful for the opportunity I was given to learn on the job. I had a couple fantastic mentors while in this role which helped shape and inform my design process and aesthetic.</p>

                <p>My first design project was working on the marketing website. I was involved in the development of the website as well. After I cut my teeth on this I moved onto designing various features for the main web application. I also redesigned and rebuilt the help centre using Wordpress.</p>

                <p>By far, the most exciting and fulfilling project was working on the internal “Saasu 2023” UI concept. This UI concept (which was undertaken in 2013) made bold prediction about what accounting software might look like 10 years in the future. This UI concept helped drive future product development such as building a global search tool and a cashflow forecasting tool. This general idea of thinking about where an industry and product might be in the long term and backwards planning from there left a strong impression on me and is something that I’ve brought to other roles.</p>
